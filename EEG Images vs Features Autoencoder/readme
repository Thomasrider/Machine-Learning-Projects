1. Data 

The Data contains EEG correlates of genetic predisposition to alcoholism. 
It can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/eeg+database.

2. Goal

The primary goal was to develop a classifier that preserves information about electrode placement position and detection timing (time and space) in the form of EEG images.

The secondary goal was to show the increase in classification accuracy by using extracted features instead of images.

3. Significant Steps

Pre-processing: Fast Fourier Transform(FFT), Frequency Binning, 2D Azimuthal Projection

Network Architecture: convolutional autoencoder for feature extraction, feedforward network for classification.

4. Results

Both goals were met with an accuracy increase of around 20 %.
