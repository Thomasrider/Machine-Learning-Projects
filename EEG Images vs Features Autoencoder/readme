1. Data 

The Data contains EEG correlates of genetic predisposition to alcoholism. 
It can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/eeg+database.

2. Goal

The primary goal was sto develop a classifer that preseverse information about electrode placement
position and detection timing (time and space) in the form of eeg images .

The scondary goal was to show the increase in classification accuracy by using extracted features instead of images.

3. Significant steps

Preprocessing: Fast Fourier Transform(FFT), Frequency Binning, 2D Azimuthal Projection
Network Architecture: convolutional autoencoder for feature extraction, feedforward network for clasification.
