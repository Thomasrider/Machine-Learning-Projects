1. Data 

The Data consists of EEG signal data and reported data about confusion from 10 college students while they watched MOOC video clips. Available at https://www.kaggle.com/wanghaohan/confused-eeg.

2. Goal

The primary goal was to model a classifier that has higher accuracy than the 67.2%, which was reported in the dataset description.
The secondary goal was to implement features selection and hyperparameter tuning techniques in the realisation of the primary goal.

3. Significant Steps

StandardScaler, SMOTE, RFECV, GridSearchCV, ROC/AUC

4. Results

Both goals were met with 81.11% accuracy. However, because data was not very unbalanced SMOTE is not essential to reach it.
